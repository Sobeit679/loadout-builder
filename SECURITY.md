# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions of the Loadout Builder:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent potential exploitation.

### 2. Report via Email

Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing us at:
**security@yourdomain.com** (replace with your actual security email)

### 3. Include the Following Information

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
- **Environment**: Browser, OS, and any relevant environment details
- **Proof of Concept**: If possible, provide a minimal proof of concept
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue

### 4. Response Timeline

We will respond to security reports within **48 hours** and provide updates on our progress.

## Security Considerations

### Data Security

This project handles game data including:

- Skill descriptions and stats
- Weapon and armor information
- User-generated loadouts (if stored locally)

**We do not collect or store personal user data.**

### Client-Side Security

Since this is a client-side application:

- All data processing happens in the browser
- No server-side data storage
- No user authentication required
- No sensitive data transmission

### Potential Security Areas

Areas where security issues might occur:

1. **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**
   - User input validation
   - Dynamic content rendering
   - Data sanitization

2. **Data Injection**
   - JSON data validation
   - Input sanitization
   - File upload handling (if applicable)

3. **Client-Side Vulnerabilities**
   - Local storage security
   - Browser security features
   - Third-party library vulnerabilities

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

When contributing to this project:

1. **Validate All Input**: Ensure all user inputs are properly validated
2. **Sanitize Data**: Sanitize any data before rendering
3. **Use Secure Libraries**: Keep dependencies updated
4. **Follow OWASP Guidelines**: Adhere to OWASP security best practices
5. **Code Review**: All security-related changes require thorough review

### For Users

To maintain security:

1. **Keep Browser Updated**: Use the latest browser version
2. **Avoid Suspicious Extensions**: Be cautious with browser extensions
3. **Check URLs**: Ensure you're using the official repository
